    "detailed_review": "Course: Machine Learning  \nProfessor: Lu Wei  \nReviewer: David Kim, Undergraduate CS & Design, SUTD\n\nProfessor Lu Wei's \"Machine Learning\" course is thoughtfully structured, with a balanced mix of theory and application. The lectures are logically organized, starting with basics and advancing to complex concepts. However, some topics felt rushed, leaving little time for in-depth understanding. Assignments are practical and reinforce learning, yet they're time-consuming, demanding a strong grasp of Python and statistics. Exams are fair but challenging, focusing on problem-solving rather than rote memorization.\n\nProfessor Wei's teaching style is clear and engaging, though sometimes the pace is brisk. His passion for the subject is evident, and he's approachable for queries, but class discussions could be more encouraged.\n\nThe course workload is heavy, requiring consistent effort, but it's greatly rewarding for practical skills development. I recommend future students brush up on their math and coding skills beforehand. Overall, it's a rigorous yet fulfilling course that equips you well for real-world applications.",

    "detailed_review": "Course: Machine Learning  \nInstructor: Professor Lu Wei  \nReviewer: David Kim, Undergraduate Computer Science and Design Student, SUTD\n\nI recently completed the \"Machine Learning\" course taught by Professor Lu Wei. The course was well-structured, with a logical progression from foundational concepts to more advanced topics. The assignments were challenging but rewarding, requiring both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. Exams were fair, though they demanded a deep grasp of the material.\n\nProfessor Wei's teaching style is clear and engaging, though at times fast-paced. His dedication to student understanding is evident, and he encourages questions and discussions, which enhances learning.\n\nIn terms of practical usefulness, this course is invaluable for anyone pursuing work in data science or AI. The workload is heavy, but manageable with consistent effort.\n\nFor future students, I recommend staying on top of the readings and starting assignments early. Engage actively in lectures and tutorials, and don't hesitate to reach out for help when needed. Overall, a demanding but highly rewarding course.",
